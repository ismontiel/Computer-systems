Collection of problem sets from the course

### PSet 1
Introduction to C. Simple printing and input

### PSet 2
Introduction to pointers

### PSet 3
Determine if text contains inputted pattern

### PSet 4
deep.c: creates a deep copy of a given string
intTail: Using a 'circular' array to keep track of last 10 inputted numbers
myTail.c: Keeps track of last ten lines in an input

### Pset 5
